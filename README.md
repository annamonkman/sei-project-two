## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
The second Project on the SEI Immersive Course was to build a React application that consumes a public API. We had 48 hours to complete this in a pair. My partner and I chose to make a simplified game of Top Trumps using a Star Wars API

Directions: Start the game, click on a category on the upfacing card to beat the down facing card. Please note that the image doesn’t change on the card but the information does. 

## <a name="tech"></a>Technologies Used
* React.js
* JavaScript (ES6)
* SASS
* CSS
* Axios
* Insomnia REST Client
* *arn
* react-router-dom
* Star Wars API 
* Adobe Photoshop

## <a name="brief"></a>Brief
The app must:
* Consume a public API
* Have several components
* Can have a router - with several “pages”
* Include Wireframes designed before building the app
* Be deployed online

### Planning

Since the brief was more open ended we spent a good amount of time coming up with an idea that suited what we both wanted to get out of the project. </br>
We looked through catalogues of external APIs for some inspiration. We both like Star Wars and found a Star Wars API. We thought this had potential either for a simple database type of project or something more interactive, since it had a large range of data and was free and accessible. I suggested Top Trumps as I used to play Star Wars Top Trumps a lot as a child, so we both tried to figure out how to do something similar that was achievable in the day and a half we had remaining. </br>
We planned an MVP that would just be a simple comparison between two cards with win, lose and draw logic, with nice-to-haves being rounds of the game and an index of all of the cards. The Star Wars API had many different categories so we chose to focus on one - Starships - at first as it had the most easily comparable data, ie. lots of numbers. We practised accessing the data sets in Insomnia to make sure it was suitable for our purposes. </br>
I wireframed the two basic pages in Photoshop, screen sharing with Oli. Then we wrote pseudocode before getting our plan signed off by the tutors. </br>

### Setting Up React

We used the GA London React Template.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We decided to code the majority of the project using Live Share 


### Styling 
Once we’d finished our MVP we went straight into styling. We split up at this point to get it done quicker, allocating ourselves different areas so our code didn’t course any merge conflicts. I added in the title made in a Font Creator App and worked on the cards - adding in the background image and editing the text, whilst my partner worked on the homepage then the win/lose/draw display on the game. 
If we had more time it would have been good to make the cards look even more like authentic Top Trumps cards. 

## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs
- We managed to solve our major game play bugs before the Reactathon ended. 
- The only major thing we didnt have time to complete was getting our own images to display on the cards according to the startship it pictures. We had to just stick to one general image of Starships. 

## <a name="challenges"></a>Challenges
- 
- There was a merge conflict with our CSS very close to the end that we had to sort quickly. 

## <a name="wins"></a>Wins
- Getting the game to work at MVP level
- Pair-coding successfully. In coding the functionality together we could work through the more diffcut bits together and impart each of our knowledge. It also meant we knew exactly what had to be done at all times- we were both on the same page. Towards the end our brains were getting tired but by working together we were abel to push through.

## <a name="future"></a>Future Improvements

## <a name="learning"></a>Key Learning
- collaborating creatively and Pair-coding successfully.
- Keeping the code organised and commenting it.
- Planning well before hand - we had to restart part of teh functionality a good way into the first day because we approached it wrongly.
