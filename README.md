# Project Two Reactathon - StarTrumps

## Contents



## Overview
The second Project on the SEI Immersive Course was to build a React application that consumes a public API. We had 48 hours to complete this in a pair. My partner and I chose to make a simplified game of Top Trumps using a Star Wars API

## Deployed Project

Directions: Start the game, click on a category on the upfacing card to beat the down facing card. Please note that the image doesn’t change on the card but the information does. 


## Technologies Used
React.js
JavaScript (ES6)
SASS
CSS
Axios
Insomnia REST Client
Yarn
react-router-dom
Star Wars API 
Adobe Photoshop

## Brief
The app must:
Consume a public API
Have several components
The app can have a router - with several “pages”
Include Wireframes designed before building the app
Be deployed online

## Process




### Planning

Since the brief was more open ended we spent a good amount of time coming up with an idea that suited what we both wanted to get out of the project. 
We looked through catalogues of external APIs for some inspiration. We both like Star Wars and found a Star Wars API. We thought this had potential either for a simple database type of project or something more interactive, since it had a large range of data and was free and accessible. I suggested Top Trumps as I used to play Star Wars Top Trumps a lot as a child, so we both tried to figure out how to do something similar that was achievable in the day and a half we had remaining. 
We planned an MVP that would just be a simple comparison between two cards with win, lose and draw logic, with nice-to-haves being rounds of the game and an index of all of the cards. The Star Wars API had many different categories so we chose to focus on one - Starships - at first as it had the most easily comparable data, ie. lots of numbers. 
I wireframed the two basic pages in Photoshop, screen sharing with Oli. Then we pseudo-coded our approach before getting it signed off by the tutors.

### Setting Up React


We decided to code the majority of the project using Live Share 


### Styling 
Once we’d finished our MVP we went straight into styling. We split up at this point to get it done quicker, allocating ourselves different areas so our code didn’t course any merge conflicts. I added in the title made in a Font Creator App and worked on the cards - adding in the background image and editing the text, whilst my partner worked on the homepage then the win/lose/draw display on the game. 
If we had more time it would have been good to make the cards look even more like authentic Top Trumps cards.
